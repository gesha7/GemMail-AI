As part of my recent work, I developed a Chrome Extension that integrates Geminiâ€™s LLM API to automatically generate intelligent, context-aware email replies directly within Gmail. This tool streamlines communication workflows and significantly enhances user productivity. I designed and implemented a robust full-stack architecture using React and Spring Boot, enabling real-time email content analysis and dynamic response generation. The result was a smooth and intuitive user interface backed by secure and efficient backend API communication.
